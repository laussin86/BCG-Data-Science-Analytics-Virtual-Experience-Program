Program has 4 modules:
            
            1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
            2: Exploratory Data Analysis
            3: Feature Engineering & Modelling
            4: Findings & Recommendations
            
 ## Task 1 - Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
Understanding the business context and problem statement.

- Done the Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing by presenting a test hypothesis of whether churn is due to customersâ€™ price sensitivity and if a discount of 20% will retain them.

## Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
Understanding the business through data

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis where i found that Approximately 10% of customers have churned and Price sensitivity has a low correlation with churn. Also provide some suggestion like Competitor price data.


## Task 3 - Feature Engineering & Modelling
Uncovering signals within the data, predicting churn probability and evaluating model performance

- Based on our analyze, we found no matter how prices changed, proportion of churning customers always stayed around 9.72% and Yearly consumption, forecasted consumption and net margin are the 3 largest drivers.

## Task 4 - Findings & Recommendations
Presenting your results and giving recommended actions to the client

- The summary will reveal that:
  1. Churn is indeed high in the SME division and 9.7% across 14606 customers
  2. Predictive model is able to predict churn but the main driver is not customer price sensitivity but Yearly consumption, forecasted consumption and net margin are the 3 largest drivers
  3. Discount strategy of 20% is effective but only if targeted appropriately so to offer discount to only to high-value customers with high churn probability.
